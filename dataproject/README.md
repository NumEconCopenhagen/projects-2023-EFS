# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data project - Danes consumption pattern** and is about the Danes consumption pattern from 1994-2021 relative to Denmarks GDP. We will investigate if it is possible to see economic ups and downs from GDP in the Danes consumption on different goods. Furthermore, we will predict consumption for 2022 with a 5% growth rate.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [gdp_con.ipynb](gdp_con.ipynb).
A number of functions have been defined and used to operate the steps for importing, cleaning, transformng and plotting the datasets: the functions are stored in [gdp_con_fun.py](gdp_con_fun.py).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. API: NRHP (dst.dk) 
2. FU07_cp.xlsx (dst.dk)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
