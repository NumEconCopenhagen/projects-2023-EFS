# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data project - Danes consumption pattern** and is about the Danes consumption pattern from 1994-2021 relative to Denmarks GDP. We will investigate if it is possible to see economic ups and downs from GDP in the Danes consumption on different goods. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [St_data_p.ipynb].
A number of functions have been defined and used to operate the steps for importing, cleaning, transformng and plotting the datasets: the functions are stored in [data_proj.py].

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. API: NRHP (dst.dk) 
1. FU07_cp.xlsx (dst.dk)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
