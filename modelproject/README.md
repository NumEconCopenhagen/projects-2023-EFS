# Overlapping Generation Model

The **Overlapping Genartion Model** is about the households basic intertemporal choices between consumption and savings and the interaction between two generations existing at the same time. We extend the model by adding population and technology growth.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [OLG_growth.ipynb](OLG_growth.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
