# Overlapping Generation Model with population growth

In this project we expand the ready-made version of the **Overlapping Generation Model** as seen in the Introduction to programming & numerical analysis lecture, by adding **population growth**.

The OLG model regards households basic intertemporal choices between consumption and savings and the interaction between two generations existing at the same time.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [OLG_growth.ipynb](OLG_growth.ipynb). 
The py file [OLG_growth_model.ipynb](OLG_growth_model.ipynb), stores the class which defines the model and the functions needed to solve it and plot the main graphs.
The py file [Analytical_solver.ipynb](Analytical_solver.ipynb), stores the codes to analytically solve some parts of the model trough the use of symbolic math tools.

**Dependencies:** The project require a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation; uses numpy, IPython.display import display, matplotlib.pyplot and sympy.
